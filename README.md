**AI Usage Behaviour Analysis
📌 Project Overview**

The AI Usage Behaviour Analysis project focuses on understanding how users interact with AI systems by analyzing usage patterns, behavior trends, and system responses.
The goal is to generate insights that help improve user experience, performance, and responsible AI usage.

This project can be useful for product teams, data analysts, AI engineers, and researchers to understand adoption, efficiency, and behavior patterns of AI tools.

🎯 **Objectives**

1.Analyze user interaction patterns with AI systems

2.Identify frequently used features and workflows

3.Detect abnormal or inefficient usage behavior

4.Generate insights for optimization and decision-making

5.Support responsible and ethical AI usage analysis
